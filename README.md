# KinkList
Updated and personalized version of the original KinkList from [Goctini](https://github.com/Goctionni/KinkList), forked from [NanoAi's version](https://github.com/NanoAi/KinkList)

[Fill this version out yourself here](https://raw.githack.com/RedKnight26/KinkList/master/kinklist.html)

If the link about isn't working (error 429 "too many requests"), just wait a few minutes and click the link again. Sadly, this is out of my control.

#### Example
